# epoi

Extract Parasite Of Interest (epoi) is a forensics tool aided to perform an automatic extraction of:

-ip addresses
-emails
-links and domains
-base64 detection
-JS ext
-malicious action words
-ransomware associated words 
-hidden files

Usage: bash epoi.sh
Just insert a target directory with the open source scripts or resources and the analysis will start.

Remember is a forensics security tool but NOT a Linux antivirus, so not trust epoi at 100%, epoi is still in continuos development!
